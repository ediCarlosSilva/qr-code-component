## Acknowledgments

I thank Hugo Lopes. He's not a front-end developer, but he's the first person in the development world who looked at me. A person who has helped me with my silliest questions anyone can have (and he has always responded politely and kindly). Our lives intersected at some point for a professional reason. It does not matter. He has been a true mentor and friend to me.
